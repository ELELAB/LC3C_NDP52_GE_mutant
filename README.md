The repository contains the input data for modeling and simulations, outputs from analyses and associated scripts to reproduce our data. 

The MD trajectories have been deposited in OSF due to space limitation. They can be downloaded from here: https://osf.io/48wzq/

More detailed README files are in each subfolder to guide the user.

Please cite our publication if you use the material in this repository.


The XXX main folders in the repository contains:

modeller_data: 
- the files and scripts to generate the models of the complexes
- the files and scripts to reproduce the model selection for simulations 
simulations_analysis -> folders, scripts, input and outputs to reproduce the analyses of md simulations or metadynamics

NOTES

The numbering of the PDB and GRO file of the complex LC3C-NDP52 G->E mutant has been shifted of 100 amino acids with respect
to what reported in UNIPROT for practical purposes. Thus E140 will be E240 in the PDB, XTC and GRO files, as an example to orient the reader.
