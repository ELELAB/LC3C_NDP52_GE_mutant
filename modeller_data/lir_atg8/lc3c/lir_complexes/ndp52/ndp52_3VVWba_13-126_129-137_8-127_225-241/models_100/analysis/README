In this directory we perform the model selection of the first round of modeling.
We
    * concatenate all the models into a trajectory using theseus
    * we calculate the solvent accessible surface of the 1 and 4
      residues of the core LIR motif
    * we calculate the main- and side-chain dihedrals of the 
      residues - we don't use them for model selection, however
    * we calculate the gyration radius of the LIR peptide
    * We use an R script to collect the values into a table and filter
      it. We remove from the final ranking tables those models that
      have sas of core LIR motif residue 1  >= 0.75 nm^2 and sas of
      core LIR motif residue 4 >= 0.5 nm^2. These values were selected
      after examining a set of experimental structure of core LIR motifs

In order to reproduce this calculation, just run:

    bash run.sh

the requirements are:
    * theseus
    * GROMACS >=5.1.5
    * R 3.6.1 with the Peptides package installed
